# QuickInstall for Blueprint

QuickInstall is a fork of an open-source **Blueprint extension** for Pterodactyl that switches to more modern APIs and adds support for more Provider. With it, you can browse, search, and install plugins from **Modrinth, SpigotMC, Bukkit, CurseForge and HangarMC** without needing to leave the panel.

No more downloading files by hand or uploading things manually. Just pick what you need, hit install, and you’re set.

---

## Features

- 📚 Browse Modrinth plugins directly from your Pterodactyl Panel.
- 🔍 Search and filter by project name, Minecraft version, and loader.
- ⬇️ One-click download & install.
- 🔒 Backend checks server permissions before installing.
- 🆓 100% free and open source.

## Folder Structure

The extension uses the usual Blueprint project structure:

```
quickinstall/
├── conf.yml
├── app/
│   └── Http/
│       └── Controllers/
│           └── Extensions/
│               └── ModrinthBrowser/
│                   └── PluginController.php
├── resources/
│   └── scripts/
│       └── components/
│           └── server/
│               └── modrinth/
│                   └── ModrinthBrowserContainer.tsx
└── routes/
    └── server.php
```

### Quick Overview:

- `conf.yml`: Extension metadata & config
- `PluginController.php`: Handles download & validation
- `ModrinthBrowserContainer.tsx`: UI code (React)
- `server.php`: Blueprint routes

---

## Requirements

To get this extension running, you'll need:

- The Pterodactyl Panel with Blueprint support
- Blueprint installed
- PHP 8 or newer
- Outbound network access to:
  - `api.modrinth.com`
  - `cdn.modrinth.com`

---

## Installation (Recommended)

The installation works best with the Blueprint package manager.

---

### 1️⃣ Download the Latest LTS Release

1. Go to this repo’s GitHub Releases page.
2. Download the most recent **LTS** release:
   ```
   modrinthbrowser.blueprint
   ```
   If the download has a version in the filename, you can rename it to the above if you prefer.

---

### 2️⃣ Upload to Your Pterodactyl Directory

Put the `modrinthbrowser.blueprint` file in your Pterodactyl root folder:

```
/var/www/pterodactyl
```

You can upload using SFTP, SCP, your file manager, or (less ideally) FTP.

Example:

```
scp modrinthbrowser.blueprint user@server:/var/www/pterodactyl/
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install the Extension

1. SSH into your server.
2. Run:
   ```
   cd /var/www/pterodactyl
   blueprint -i modrinthbrowser.blueprint
   ```
3. After installing, clear caches and rebuild assets if necessary:
   ```
   php artisan optimize:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```
4. If your setup requires it, restart your panel services.

---

## Uninstalling

To remove the extension, run:

```
cd /var/www/pterodactyl
blueprint -remove modrinthbrowser.blueprint
```

Don't forget to clear the cache afterwards:

```
php artisan optimize:clear
```

---

## Updating

Just uninstall the old version and install the new one. Here’s a quick process:

### Recommended Update Process

1. Remove the old version:
   ```
   blueprint -remove modrinthbrowser.blueprint
   ```
2. Download the latest LTS release from GitHub.
3. Upload the new file to `/var/www/pterodactyl`.
4. Install again:
   ```
   blueprint -i modrinthbrowser.blueprint
   ```
5. Clear cache:
   ```
   php artisan optimize:clear
   ```
6. Restart your panel services if needed.

## How it Works

### Frontend

The panel interface lives here:

```
resources/scripts/components/server/modrinth/ModrinthBrowserContainer.tsx
```

It’s all React + Tailwind, talking to the backend and Modrinth’s API.

### Backend

This is the controller doing the heavy lifting:

```
app/Http/Controllers/Extensions/ModrinthBrowser/PluginController.php
```

It:

- Checks and validates requests
- Verifies your user/server has the right permissions
- Streams plugin files securely
- Drops them in the correct server folder

### Security

- Enforces `file.create` permission checks.
- Validates all project/version IDs.
- Prevents directory traversal attacks.
- Uses Pterodactyl’s built-in storage APIs.

## 🛠️ Developing & Local Testing

To run locally, you can place the extension here:

```
.blueprint/extensions/ModrinthBrowser
```

Then use:

```
blueprint -i modrinthbrowser
```

You’ll get hot reloads for most changes.
